Description: DegenPrimer is a tool to check the quality of degenerate primers. 
 It calculates melting temperatures, finds stable dimers, hairpins and crossdimers, 
 uses a BLAST search and full-fledged PCR simulation cycle by cycle to 
 provide accurate predictions of possible PCR products and their quantities. 
 It has a simple command line interface.
