degen-primer (2.1-rc1-0ppa1) precise; urgency=low

  * ipcress from exonerate package is no longer used. Search for primers' annealing sites is implemented inside degen_primer using fft-based algorithm which depends only on scipy. This algorithm is considerably faster and less memory demanding.
  * Some bugfixes and optimisations were made, especially in PCR simulation which now wokrs several times faster as well.
  * More steps in the analysis pipeline are parallelized to take advantage of multicore systems.

degen-primer (2.0-rc5-0ppa1) precise; urgency=low

  * Changed the way histogram is represented. Each row is now multiline in order to display all the information about a product. Also to the information about a product the list of primers which gave it is added. Products are filtered by quantity now. Description of histogram was updated.
  * Important bugfixes in iPCR algorithm.

degen-primer (2.0-rc1-0ppa1) precise; urgency=low

  * New features:
  All thermodynamic parameters (including stability of secondary structures) are calculated at a temperature of annealing provided through --PCR-T option.
  Thermodynamic tables are now installed separately in csv format and may be easily checked.
  Stability of secondary structures is described not only by vague dG but also by conversion degree at equilibrium, which is a way more convenient.
  Added full-fledged simulation of PCR. Temperature, polymerase activity, number of cycles separate concentrations of template and each primer, polymerisation time (calculated from maximum amplicon length), affinity of each primer to each annealing site and stability of secondary structures -- all are taken into account. This allows accurate prediction of quantities of PCR products. And variation of these parameters may provide some insights into mechanics of complex PCR systems.
  Changed BLAST query parameters. Generaly, search results are now less specific, which give more information on possible side products. Still not nearly as much as ipcress gives.
  BLAST results are reported in a more descriptive manner: each alignment is displayed as a dimer of found template sequence with a full, not truncated primer (with dangling ends when they exist). Stability of each alignment is described in the same terms as in the report of secondary structures. Hits are filtered and sorted by stability of their alignments, which are filtered and sorted as well. Added list of all hits with short info for each at the beginning of a report.
  CPU or time consuming tasks (namely, PCR sumulation, calculation of equilibrium states, BLAST query) are parallelized at subprocess level. So multicore processors should give considerable speadup.
  * Plus bugfixes, code refactoring and improvment

  * improvements:
  BLAST results are filtered by their free energy, not by the number of mismatches.
  Electrophoresis is now logarithmic as it should be, not linear.
  * changes:
  Configuration architecture has been unified for both command line and graphical interface.
