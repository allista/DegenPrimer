* concentration of each primer should be defined separately in the config
* add number of PCR cycles as config option
* try to vary parameters of BLAST query
* PCR_Results<-Blast: add primer annealing regions which do not produce PCR product as side-reactions
* for filedialogs in GUI save sizes too
* use some graphics library to make PDF plots of PCR phoresis (apparently, mathplotlib)
