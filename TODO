  SearchEngine: parallelize _construct_duplexes method.
  
  Add description member to Duplex to hold the name of a primer.
  PCR_Simulation: add products report with graphical representation of annealing sites.
  
  PCR_Simulation: add primer annealing regions which do not produce PCR product as side-reactions.
  PCR_Simulation: also add primer annealing variants with dissociated 3' end as side-reactions.
  
  Add some progress bar.
  Add search capability to the GUI view tabs.
  Make Entrez query of PCR products.
  
? take into account primer-dimers synthesis.
? use some graphics library to make PDF plots of PCR phoresis (apparently, mathplotlib).
