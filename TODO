* add separate/mixed mode to iPCR (?)
* more convenient BLAST hits report with Tm-s and/or dG, with a list of all hits in the header
* PCR-products histogram should somehow show absolute product quantities
* for filedialogs in GUI save sizes too
* use some graphics library to make PDF plots of PCR phoresis (apparently, mathplotlib)
