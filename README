DegenPrimer is a tool to check the quality of degenerate primers. It calculates 
melting temperatures, finds stable dimers, hairpins and crossdimers, makes a 
BLAST search for specificity and prepare input for ipcress (in silica PCR 
simulation program). It has a simple command line interface. It is written in 
python using BioPython library.

All calculations of thermodynamic parameters are made using Nearest Neighbor 
model and the latest thermodynamic tables with corrections for particular PCR 
conditions.

In addition to degen_primer itself, the helper scripts parse_blast is included. 
It parses previously saved blast xml output and produces human readable report.

The align_as_amino tool is still provided but will be soon moved into 
the BioUtils project.

It depends on python2 >= 2.7 and Biopython >= 1.58
