DegenPrimer is a tool to check the quality of degenerate primers. It calculates 
melting temperatures, finds stable dimers, hairpins and crossdimers, makes a 
BLAST search for specificity and prepare input for ipcress (in silica PCR 
simulation program). It has a simple command line interface. It is written in 
python using BioPython library.

All calculations of thermodynamic parameters are made using Nearest Neighbor 
model and the latest thermodynamic tables with corrections for particular PCR 
conditions.

In addition to degen_primer itself, two helper scripts are included:
1) align_as_amino — which aligns nucleotide sequences translating them prior to 
alignment, then reverse the translation using original sequences. It uses 
MUSCLE as a backend to perform the alignment.
2) parse_blast — which parses previously saved blast xml output and produces 
human readable report. The original NCBI BLAST txt reports are more informative 
though.

It depends on python2 >= 2.7 and Biopython >= 1.58
