DegenPrimer is a tool to check the quality of degenerate primers. It calculates 
melting temperatures, finds stable dimers, hairpins and crossdimers, uses a 
BLAST search and ipcress (in silica PCR simulation program from exonerate 
package) as a starting point for full-fledged PCR simulation cycle by cycle to 
provide accurate predictions of possible PCR products and their quantities.
It has a simple command line interface as well as a GUI (which is a separate 
package: https://launchpad.net/degenprimergui).
It is written in python using SciPy and BioPython libraries.

All calculations of thermodynamic parameters are made using Nearest Neighbor 
model and the latest thermodynamic tables with corrections for particular PCR 
conditions.

The align_as_amino tool is still provided but will be soon moved into 
the BioUtils project.

Dependecies: python2 >= 2.7, 
             Biopython >= 1.58, 
             SciPy >= 0.9,
             exonerate (optional, yet strongly recommended)
